1. install msys2
	get installer from http://www.msys2.org/
	"x86_64" for 64-bit, "i686" for 32-bit windows

	after installation, launch msys2 and update the system using the following
	> pacman -Syu
	
	if required, force quit msys2, relunch it, and resume update by running the following
	> pacman -Syu

	then, you can quit msys2 for now.

2. copy the tar ball to anywhere you can access through msys2
	Probably the easiest option for 64bit is C:\msys64\home\{yousername}, but it's up to you.

3. install minGW to msys2
	run msys2 64 bit (or 32bit) from the start menu
	then install "base-devel" and "mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain"
	 (or "mingw-w64-i686-toolchain" for 32bit) using the following
	> pacman -S base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain

4. install libraries to msys2
	> pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-libxml++

5. build ndmanager plugins
	> cd ndmanager-plugins
	> make
	> make install

6. take files generated in ~/ndmanager-plugins/bin/ to anywhere you want (and add it to PATH, if you want)

7. enjoy the products!
